ME: Here's this ETL pipeline code from "Assignment 2" (I pasted the assignment 2 code here). I need you to change it to follow these instructions for Assignment 3: 1. Start with your Assignment 2 solution. 2. Use a generative AI assistant to brainstorm ways to make it more object-oriented. 3. Redesign your solution into multiple classes with clearer responsibilities. 4. Your program must still meet the exact same requirements as Assignment 2: same inputs, same outputs, same transformations, same error handling, and same relative paths.



CLAUDE: Perfect! Let's tackle Assignment 3 step by step. This is about redesigning your ETL pipeline to be more object-oriented while maintaining the exact same functionality.
Let me help you brainstorm an object-oriented design first, then we'll implement it.
Initial OO Design Brainstorming
Here are some key classes we could create:

Product - Represents a single product with its properties
ProductTransformer - Handles all transformation logic
CSVReader - Handles reading CSV files
CSVWriter - Handles writing CSV files
ETLPipeline - Main orchestrator class
PriceRangeCalculator - Calculates price ranges
ProductValidator - Validates product data

This design demonstrates:

Encapsulation: Each class has specific responsibilities
Objects/Classes: Clear separation of concerns
Potentially Polymorphism: Different transformers could implement a common interface

Would you like me to:

Start implementing these classes with proper OO design?
Create the main ETLPipeline orchestrator?
Begin with the Product class and work our way up?

Which approach would you prefer? I'll document all the AI interactions as we go for your AI_PROMPTS file.



ME: I've made some of the files we need. Just give me the code for the split-up class files. Remember, they have to work just like the assignment 2 code I gave you beforehand did.



CLAUDE: There are your five main classes! Here's what we've created:
Object-Oriented Design Summary
Classes Created:

Product - Encapsulates product data with getters/setters
ProductTransformer - Handles all transformation logic
CSVReader - Manages reading CSV files into Product objects
CSVWriter - Manages writing Product objects to CSV files
ETLPipeline - Main orchestrator that coordinates the process

OO Concepts Demonstrated:

Encapsulation: Each class has a single responsibility
Objects/Classes: Clear separation of data (Product) and behavior (Transformer, Reader, Writer)
Method decomposition: Complex operations broken into focused methods
Error handling: Distributed across appropriate classes

Key Features:

Same exact functionality as Assignment 2
Proper Javadoc documentation for all classes and public methods
Maintains all error handling (missing files, empty files, malformed data)
Same input/output behavior and file paths




ME: Okay, I ran the commands and tested case A, B, and C. Does this output screenshot look right?




CLAUDE: Perfect! Your object-oriented implementation is working exactly like Assignment 2. Let me verify what I see:
Test Results Analysis
Case A (Normal Input):

✅ Extracted 6 data rows
✅ Transformed 6 rows
✅ 0 rows skipped
✅ Same summary format

Case B (Empty Input):

✅ Extracted 0 data rows
✅ Transformed 0 rows
✅ Still creates output file
✅ Clean handling

Case C (Missing File):

✅ Clear error message: "Input file not found: data/products.csv. Please ensure the file exists in the data/ directory."
✅ Graceful exit without crashing
